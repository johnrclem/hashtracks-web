## Wix Events widget (learned from BoiseH3, 2026-05-28)

- **Detection:** `<meta name="generator" content="Wix.com Website Builder">` in page head; `static.wixstatic.com` CDN assets.
- **Feed reality:** Wix sites often render the **current** event inline as static HTML on the home page (server-rendered), while the dedicated `/events` or `/events-3` calendar page uses a JS-rendered Wix Events widget. If only the current or next event is needed, a static home-page Cheerio parse is more reliable than browser-render.
- **Home-page parse:** Look for `<h1|h2|h3>Hash #NNN</h1>` or equivalent heading, then traverse `.nextAll()` until the next heading or a sentinel phrase (`We need Hares!`). **Climb to the `[data-testid="richTextElement"]` container first** — Wix wraps each content block in such a div, so the heading and following paragraphs are siblings at the container level, not siblings of the `<h1>` itself. Content-keyed traversal is required — Wix rotates opaque CSS class names.
- **Events widget:** Use `fetchBrowserRenderedPage(url, { waitFor: "body", timezoneId: "America/Boise" })` and look for `[data-hook*="event"]` or `[class*="eventList"]` containers. For BoiseH3, the `/events-3` page loads only CSS bundles (978 KB) with no SSR'd event data — the widget content is fully JS-rendered and the home-page parse remains the canonical path.
- **iCal:** Wix exposes per-event `?format=ical` links via the public widget but NOT a collection-level iCal feed by default — do not use as the primary source URL.
- **Coord trap:** If Wix Events exposes `lat`/`lng` per event, verify they differ across events. Repeated identical coordinates indicate a tenant-default venue pin (same trap as Squarespace) — reject and emit `dropCachedCoords: true`.
- **Logos:** `static.wixstatic.com/media/<hash>~mv2.<ext>` URLs are tokenized and rotate when the kennel re-uploads assets. Always self-host into `public/kennel-logos/<code>.<ext>` and reference that path.
- **Effort:** Small new static scraper (~130–180 LoC + tests) if only the home-page block is needed; larger (~400+ LoC, mirror `northboro-hash.ts`) if the events-page widget must be parsed via browser-render.
